Five ways there are to enter the

If you do not possess a keystone

canyon entrance, they will only
let you pass if you tell them
\"the other world awaits\". I

those peasants damage the portal.

#Geology Digest#
"The wonders of our terrain: 
One of the many wonders of our 
world is the huge variety of 
terrains presented. There are 
forests, swamps, deserts and 
lakes. Far in the north there 
is also an ice desert to be 
found, but traveling there 
is very hard.",
#The biggest Catastrophes"
"One of the biggest mysteries 
of our world is the yearly 
reoccurance of earthquakes. 
Data pulled from the archives 
suggests that the intensity 
of the earthquakes rise with 
each year, reach huge levels 
of destruction by the 57th year 
and go back to minimal intensity 
in the 58th year. There has been 
lots of research on this topic, 
but the cause of said earthquakes 
could not be identified.",
#Letter to Jill#
"Dear Jill, 
Please stop asking about my 
research. I absolutely won’t 
tell you anything else about 
it. And no, the rumors neither 
have anything to do with it, 
nor are they true. 
Please say hi to mom from me. 

        In love, Thomas",
#Lab Instructions#
"Instruction to enter the lab: 
To all scientists. 
Please be aware that there has 
been rumors in certain social 
classes that suggest the unexpected 
intensifying of the earthquakes 
has to do with our recent research. 
I advice you to avoid contact with 
said classes. In case contact can 
not be avoided, stay calm and don’t 
let them provoke you. I remind you, 
that it is forbidden to speak about 
our research to outsiders. Note also 
that the entry to the shrine has 
been sealed - to enter it, look out 
for the yellow flower by the statue 
near the entrance. Rotate the 
head of the flower to enter. ",

#Jill's diary#
"Dear diary, I’m worried about 
my brother. There have been all 
sorts of bad rumors about his 
research lately. Neighbours who
knew him since he was a little 
boy started to talk about him 
like he’s an evil cultist. Even 
mother is mad at him for not 
showing up and explaining himself. 
She thinks our family has a bad 
reputation now because of him...",
#Religion and Society#
"Man is the crown of creation. 
But is this really true? Or are 
we mere intruders who came to 
a closed environment and enforced 
us to its nature? If we developed
inside this environment, why does
it seem that it tries to push us
away? Ever since we can remember,
there have been catastrophies, 
taking hundrets of lifes at once
and it seems those catastrophies
are getting growing in number and 
impact. What if we are 
misinterpreting our role in our 
world? What if the world doesn’t 
even want us here?",
#Farming Calendar#

#Farming Contract#
"Dear Mr. Cobbot,
when you have the arranged 
amount of vegetables, we 
will open a magic portal 
near the big tree outside 
your farm.
Remember these are the 
asked vegetables:
3x Lettuce, 1x Tomatoes,
3x Turnip, 2x Potatoes",
#Letter from Nick#
"Be careful on your way to get 
our next batch of vegetables. 
Mr. Cobbot has been really nice 
to us, but something about him 
seems fishy. How is he growing 
his vegetables so fast? With all
the cows he has, how come no 
wild animals ever attack him? 
        Nick",

#Fabian's Diary#
"I’m afraid our research came 
to an end. The are more and more 
riots every day. The farmers keep 
blaming us for the earthquakes 
and refuse to sell us food. The 
farmers we already have been 
working with simply disappear… 
Yet the leaders refuse to let us 
explain anything to the people. 
Maybe I should just... ",
#Roadder’s manifest#
"The life has chosen you and you 
can’t run from this choise. Whenever 
you look at a smiling man or a 
screaming child, at water flowing 
or fire burning, you will face this. 
Your actions is what life needs. 
You are choosing your paths. 
As long as there is earth, there 
are paths. As long as there is light, 
you can cast a shadow. As long as 
there is air, there will be wind. 
And sometimes it will blow into 
your back. 
I will tell you my story, but I 
want you to read yours. 
I will start. And only you will 
decide where to stop.",
#Call to the People#
"Brethren! How long will we 
have to suffer under the rule 
of the Order of the Scholars? 
Their doings has caused nothing 
but harm to us! 
Let’s stop this rule of misery!",
#Assignment#
" Scholar Fabian is behaving 
strange lately. He has been 
arguing against the necessity 
of concealment and wasn’t seen 
at the lab for several days. 
Reports show, he has build a 
shelter in the caves below the 
forest. Search his shelter. In 
case you find something 
incriminating, do as you must 
to resolve the situation.",

#News#
"Last week another city was 
destroyed. The earthquakes are 
now so bad, entire houses have 
been collapsing into the void. 
If this goes on, how can we 
survive?",
#Letter to Maike#
"Maike, I did it! I spoke to 
the captain of the last ship 
and convinced him to take us 
aboard! I know, you have doubts 
about living on a ship… But you 
have to realise that living on 
land is getting too dangerous! 
Please come to the harbor in two 
days. Only take the most necessary.

"With all this problems lately, 
people forget how to smile. Mama, 
please bake one of your famous 
cakes tomorrow! I will invite the 
neighbors over, so they might 
relax a bit.",
#Ben's Diary
"There are no reports from the 
other cities anymore. Have they 
decided not to bother anymore? 
Or is there no one left to report? 
… 
It’s getting harder to believe that 
she is still alive. Her neighbors 
wrote a while ago that she went to 
another village to buy eggs and 
never returned. The village 
collapsed… But sometimes missing 
people return. Maybe she just got 
lost in the woods. Maybe… 
Oh god, please let her be alive!

"The Legend of Desn is an old 
fairy-tale that is used to scare 
little farmer’s kids: “Be nice to 
the nature or the gods will punish 
you!”. There are no recordings of 
the so called “Arrival” nor evidence 
for the human factor in the 
earthquakes. The legend itself 
isn’t complete, there are certain 
pieces that were lost for centuries. ",
#X2
"We were able to make contact to 
another dimension! The messages 
between our worlds travel long 
but it seems we have met other 
human beings. Their research is 
similar to ours but their world 
seems more advanced. 
",
#X3
"The Contact was very benefitial 
for us so far. Our brethren on 
the other side told us about 
their world, it seems it operates 
completely without magic! This is 
pretty hard to imagine but I hope 
we can learn how to use those 
technologies they’ve been writing 
us about. I do hope we can meet 
in person at some time. ",
#X4
"Incredible news! 
Our brethren from the other side 
are building a portal to make a 
direct contact! They will adjust 
it to react to our main portal. 
Their research will take some 
time though",
#X5
"There are no messages from our 
brethren from the other side anymore. 
We sent several messages to them but 
no reaction. I wonder if everything 
is alright? Farmers have been rioting 
lately and the food situation is 
getting worse… I hope they will send 
us a message soon, we need help 
immediately.",

"Part I: Long ago there was no 
man in the land we now call Desn. 
It was filled with beautiful 
creatures and beasts that lived 
together in peace and harmony. 
The water was so pure, it could heal. 
Corn took only a heartbeat to grow 
and the food was plenty. 
Magic ruled the world.",
#
"Part II: Then the human came. 
Their arrival was met with agression. 
They never belonged in this world and 
thus disturbed the harmony of the 
beings. What’s worse, the world they 
came from was not magic by nature and 
Desn’s magic decreased to repair the 
damage the Arrival has done. The water 
lost its healing powers. Only a few 
places kept the magic in their soil 
that helped to grow food. The beasts 
turned against each other, when they 
felt hunger for the first time in 
their lifes.",
#
"Part III: The gods of Desn were 
furious. How dare these imperfect 
beings destroy their world? To punish
the intruders they sent earthquakes. 
Each year the earthquakes would increase 
in might and destructiveness. Many 
men would die. When enough died, the 
gods would show mercy and the 
catastrophies would end. But ignorant 
humans would gain strength again and 
the gods would punish them again and 
again in a neverending cycle.",
#
"Part IV: It is said that once there 
will be a second Arriving. The world 
will come to an end, as there will be
no magic left in this world to protect
the land from the inevitable destruction.
All men will die a horrible dead. The 
most creatures and beasts will follow 
them. The second Arrival will make Desn
an empty and miserable place. ",
#
"Part V: You who read this legend, 
beware! Desn is doomed and it is 
up to you to prevent its complete 
destruction!"
